# Temperature Controlled Voltage Source
Built a Temperature Controller Voltage Source circuit as the Final Project for course Integrated Electronics (ECE_214)

## Brief Intro
Aim was to design a Temperature to Voltage Converter using Temperature Sensor (Thermistor) and Operational Amplifier. 
Used Proteus Simulation Tool to realize the circuit.

Main components used were:
* DC Output Meter
* NTC Thermistor
* 4136 Quad OpAmp
